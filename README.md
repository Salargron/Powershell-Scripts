# Timer_Powershell
This was both an exercise to get used to Powershell fundamentals and to put together a simple timer for everything from brewing tea to workout set intervals.  It's also an example I can keep handy for how to work with and use control characters in a windows console when I want to format the output.  It's main weakness is that it relies on the sleep command and doesn't check the countdown against the system clock.  My testing showed that this wasn't really an issue with my current system for the countdown durations that I typically use.

I included the .bat file, because that's how I prefer to run it.  
The one file dependency in this version is C:\Windows\Media\Ring01.wav.
